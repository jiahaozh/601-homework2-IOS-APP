This is a individial homework by Zhang Jiahao. And this is the first time for me to bulid a resume webpage and build an IOS app<br>
The homework is divided into two parts:<br>

## Resume Webpage
I made my own resume webpage and utilized firebase authentication function.
### Test task

In the testing period, Firstly I tested webpage link and login part, which are in high priority. Then I tested three contact links (GitHub, Twitter and Facebook link). Finally, I tested firebase database information.<br>

#### 2. Automate Testing
In this part, I test Yanxing Zhang's webpage


## IOS APP
I designed a simplified meal-tracking app called FoodTracker following the detailed step-by-step tutorial in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1. The main task I did was building the UI. During the process I have learned how to build a basic UI, how to connect UI to code, work with view controller, implement a custom control and define data model.<br>
