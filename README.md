# 601-homework2-IOS-APP
This is a individial homework by Zhang Jiahao. And this is the first time for me to build an IOS app, even an app.<br>

Â In the homework, I designed a simplified meal-tracking app called FoodTracker following the detailed step-by-step tutorial in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1.<br>
 
The main task I did was building the UI. During the process I have learned how to build a basic UI, how to connect UI to code, work with view controller, implement a custom control and define data model.
